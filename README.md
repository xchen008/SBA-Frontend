# SBA-Frontend

This project is a Skill-based Assessment for Per Scholas Java Full-Stack Bootcamp. This project is aimed to test your ability to create website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript. 

For this SBA, I will be creating a 4 page website for workout programs. It will consist of 4 pages (home, profile, training program and nutrition plans). 

Technical requirements are below:

HTML

Have at least 3 pages, keep the grid system consistent as much as possible
Use at least 10 different HTML tags
Use HTML tables
Implement at least two uses for forms
Dropped Down Menu 
Use web fonts
Use different types of content in the form of text, images, videos, and GIFs
Use regex validation

CSS

Inline, internal, and external styling
Use five different CSS selectors
Donâ€™t use too many fonts
Use colors that complement each other
Use Flexbox (Optional)
Use SASS/SCSS (Optional)
Use animations (Optional)

Javascript

External scripts
Use variables, if statements, loops, at least one form of collections, functions/call back, and events
Use AJAX (Optional) 
Use JSON or XML (Optional)
Use JQuery (Optional)


From the requirements, I did not use tables because I used bootstrap for the layout. I did not used form but I used input elements and buttons
The dropdown menu can be access when hover over the profile icon from any page. For Javascript, I used arrays as collection.
